# Phone Tones

just dabbling with tone generation in JS. this seems to only work in Chrome.

Based on the crap I read on:

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_box_(phreaking)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_box_(phreaking)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling

This code really shouldn;'t be used for anything.
